<b>District and School Summary</b>

This challenge analyes data from a school district with 15 schools serving 39,170 high school students, with a total budget of $82,932,329,558.00. The top 5 performing schools for overall passing percentages are Cabera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School, and Pena High School, which are all charter schools. The lowest performing schools are Rodriguez High School, Figueroa High School, Huang High School, Hernandez High School, and Johnson High School, which are all district schools. The budget per student for top and bottom performing schools, ranged from $578-655. However, the largest district school was at times more than 2,000 students larger.

<b>By Grade Summary</b>

The changes in scores do not appear to be impact by grade level for either math or reading. However, the scores were more consistently high for reading than compared to math for all grades.

<b>Scores by School Spending</b>
From this data analysis it appears that schools that spend more per student perform worse than schools that spend less per student. Schools that spend less that %585 have an overall pass rate of 90.4%, while schools that spend $645-680 have an overall passrate of 53.5%.

  <i><u>Caveat</i></u><br>
 This analysis does not compare the cost of spending to school size. The schools that spend less are charter schools and have much smaller student bodies. It is likely that opperating a school with over 4,000 students requires higher spending per student. However, this variable is unknown.
 
 <b>School Size</b>
 It this analysis shows that both small(less than 1000 students) and medium(1000-2000 students) perform well. Both size categories have passing rates of approximately 90%. Large schools(2000-50000 student) perform significantly worse at 58%.
 
<b>School Type</b>
Charter schools appear to out perform district schools in reading scores, math scores, and overall passing rates. Charter schools' reading passing rate was 96.6%, math passing rate was 93.6% and overall passing of 90.4%. While district schools have an average reading passage rate of 80.8%, math passing rate of 66.4%, and overall passing rate of 53.7%.

<b>Conclusion</b>
Based solely on the numbers, it appears that smaller charter schools perform better than larger public schools that spend more per student.

Further information that would be needed to allow for a more definitive conclusion would include student demographics, family socioeconomic status, percent of free and reducued lunch, numbers of English language learners, and school enrollment practices.
